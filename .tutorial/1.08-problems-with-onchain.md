# Problems With On-Chain Payments

Okay, so we've reviewed various types of Bitcoin transactions such as Pay-To-Witness-Script-Hash, timelocks, and multisig. Got it! These all seem like they work quite well for sending bitcoin. Why do we need to make things more compliacted? 

While on-chain transactions are effective, they have some limitations when it comes to creating a global payment system. 

- They're **slow**: For a Bitcoin transaction to be considered final, the recipient needs to wait for the transaction to be mined into a new block. On average, a block is mined every 10 minutes.

- They're **expensive**: The sender needs to pay (incentivize) miners to include their transaction in a block. Historically, fees have been relatively low (less than $2), but they can reach over $50 during times of extreme blockspace demand. This poses a few problems. For example, what if we want to send $1 of bitcoin to someone?

- They don't **scale**. Every transaction made must be relayed, verified, and stored by the Bitcoin network, indefinitely. For Bitcoin to scale to support 8 billion people, we can't rely solely on on-chain transactions; we need more efficient solutions!
