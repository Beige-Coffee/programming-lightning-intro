# Penalty Mechanism

A **penalty mechanism** is a system, rule, or process that is designed to discourage undesirable or dishonest behavior. It accomplishes this by imposing a negative consequence or penalty on individuals or entities that violate the rules or norms of that system.

Think back to our fairness protocol example from earlier. If Alice attempted to "cheat" Bob when cutting the cake, Bob could "punish" Alice by taking the plate with more cake. Things were so simple back then!

#### Can you think of a rule or mechanism we can implement in our channel to allow one party to punish the other if they attempt to cheat?

Within the context of commitment transactions, we can incentivize good behavior by adding the following penalty mechanism rule:

### If you publish an old commitment transaction, the counterparty is allowed to steal all of the funds you have on your side of the channel.

To enforce this rule, we can add an additional spending path to the output such that, if Alice attempts to cheat by publishing an old channel state, Bob can steal all of her funds.

Implementing this rule is going to require some fun, but slightly advanced, cryptographic skillz. Head over to the next page to see how it's done!
