# Bitcoin Transactions
Under the hood, the Lightning Network is supported by clever Bitcoin transactions!

To keep the network trustless, decentralized, and secure, we use a variety of advanced features such as timelocks, spending paths, and multi-signature setups.

We'll break it down step by step, introducing each concept gradually to build a solid understanding. Once we've covered the basics, we'll see how all these elements come together to create "payment channels".


## Bitcoin Transaction: Inputs and Outputs

A bitcoin transaction primarily consists of **inputs** and **outputs**.

- An **input** is a pointer to a previous transaction’s output, paired with a Bitcoin script that proves ownership by satisfying the output’s conditions.

- An **output** is an amount of bitcoin and a script that "locks" it, determining how it can be spent in the future.

To visualize this, consider the diagram below...
- A **signature** icon, unsurprisingly, represents a *signature* for a specific color-coded public key, placed in the `witness` field. For pre-segwit transactions, it was placed in the `scriptSig` field.
- A **lock** icon symbolizes a *public key* that bitcoin is locked to, located in the ```scriptPubKey``` field. As we venture into the land of Lightning, we'll encounter many public keys, so hopefully these color-coded icons will help keep things organized.

The above output is a simple **Pay-To-Witness-Public-Key-Hash** (**P2WPKH**) output. We are taking the HASH160 of a public key and putting the 20-byte result in the `scriptPubKey` field with an `OP_0` in front of it. The `OP_0` signals to the Bitcoin protocol that this is a **P2WPKH** or **P2WSH** output.

To spend from a P2WPKH output, you provide a valid signature and the unhashed public key:

## Segregated Witness (SegWit)

Segregated Witness, also known as "SegWit", was a soft-fork upgrade to Bitcoin that was activated in 2017. Why are we mentioning SegWit in this workshop? Well, SegWit was actually a crucial upgrade to Bitcoin, enabling stronger security guarantees for Lightning.

#### Why was SegWit an important upgrade for Lightning?

<details> <summary>Answer</summary>
  
SegWit moved signature data from the `scriptSig` (within transaction inputs) to a separate structure called the **witness stack**.

This change was critical because it eliminated the possibility of **transaction malleability**. Transaction malleability refers to the ability to alter the signature's byte representation (e.g., through valid but slightly different encoding) **after the transaction is broadcast** but **before it is mined**. Such changes would result in a different transaction ID (txid), even though the transaction itself remained valid and unchanged.

This vulnerability made it unsafe to build off-chain payment protocols like the Lightning Network, which rely on transaction IDs to remain constant.

By moving the signature data to the witness stack, which is not included in the transaction ID hash, SegWit ensured that the transaction ID could no longer be altered through malleability attacks.
