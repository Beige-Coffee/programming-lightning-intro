# Refund the Channel

If Bob becomes unresponsive or stops cooperating with Alice, then Alice needs to have a backup plan so that she can retrieve her funds from the payment channel. More broadly, this is often referred to as the capability to "exit" an off-chain system. Ideally, Alice (or any user) should be able to "unilaterally exit", meaning that they do not need assistance from anyone else to exit.

## Use Multiple Spending Paths and Timelocks
#### ⚠️ The "Multiple Spending Paths and Timelocks" protocol is not how Lightning actually works. That said, it's a simpler payment channel construction, and it's a helpful starting point as we work towards a modern Lightning channel.

There are different ways to implement the ability to "refund" a channel balance. One approach is to **use multiple spending paths** and **timelocks** to ensure that the channel balance can be refunded to Alice if something goes wrong. For example, we can implement the following spending paths:

1) The first spending path checks to see if both Aice's and Bob's signatures are provided. If so, that is sufficient to satisfy the conditions on this output and spend the funds. Nice!
2) If not, we can check if a relative timelock has passed since this transaction was confirmed on chain. For example, we could add a condition that says, if 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) have passed since the funding transaction was confirmed, then Alice can spend this output to herself. **This would act as Alice "refunding" her channel balance.**

#### Question: What downside did the introduction of timelocks create?

They gave our channels a limited lifetime. Bob must close the channel before the timelock expires otherwise Alice can take all of her funds back using the refund spending path.
