# Implementing Lightning

## Basis Of Lightning Technology (BOLT)
At it's core, Lightning is a fairness protocol that enables trustless exchanges of value without a third party. We got a taste of this fairness protocol in the "Intro to Payment Channels" section, where we learned how multiple parties can route payments to each other. While we reviewed a lot, we still left out many details!

All of the details explaining how Lightning works are described in the **Basis Of Lightning Technology** (**BOLT**) protocol specifications. Since Lightning is decentralized, there is no central authority dictating how Lightning must evolve or distributing the sole application client on which Lightning runs. For example, X (formerly, Twitter) is only accessible via the app or website. You cannot create a new application that integrated with X without their permission.

Lightning is different. It's an open protocol. Anyone is free to build a Lightning app and join the party, which is why we need very public and explicit documentation for how Lightning works.


## Lightning Development Kit
It would be a massive undertaking to attempt to implement the entire functionality specified in the BOLTs in order to operate a node on the Lightning network. There are a few of out-of-the-box implementations available to you if all you would like to do is operate a node, however, if you want to customize the behavior of how they work you either need to fork and then maintain the project or write plugins that would alter the default behavior. Regardless of the path you take they all are still delivered as a binary and need to be run and controlled over various RPC interfaces.

The **Lightning Development Kit** (**LDK**) takes a different approach. LDK is a library that implements the Lightning network protocol but gives you the ability to integrate it directly into your application in exactly the fashion that best suits your needs.

It exposes a broad but extremely powerful set of objects and events for you to utilize when customizing your users' Lightning experience.

LDK enables you to choose your own data storage, wallet, networking stack and blockchain monitoring. In the diagram above the boxes with dotted borders are LDK's modules — these must be configured with either default or custom implementations that you provide.

LDK also uses an event-driven architecture which allows for asynchronous result notification. For example you perform actions like making payments without waiting for the result and are later made aware via an event if the payment was successful or not.

A better description and overview of these components can be found on their website and corresponding documentation but here's a quick glimpse into the high level components we will be interacting with:

### ChannelManager

Exposes dozens of methods for opening, making payments over, and closing channels.  This handles the majority of the logic required for operating channels on the lightning network.

### PeerManager

Handles all of the p2p protocol messaging layer.  Flexible enough to allow you to bring your own networking stack.  Provide LDK with raw TCP/IP socket data and the library will handle the rest for you.  LDK does provide a default implementation should your needs not require a custom networking layer. 

### KeysInterface

An abstraction over all of the key material you will need to manage.  Again, LDK provides sane default implementation for some applications while giving you the flexibility to customize to fit whatever key management requirements you might have.

### Persist interface

An abstraction over key-value storage to persist essential lightning protocol data.  LDK provides an implementation that uses a filesystem to persist all of your data but you can easily plug any database or storage solution.

### Listen / Confirm interfaces

LDK needs to be notified of new blocks and/or confirmed transactions.  If you have access to full blocks via bitcoind then you'd want to implement the `Listen` interface.  If you only have access to transactions relevant to specific outputs via electrum or esplora then you'd want to implement the `Confirm` interface.

LDK does provide implementations for using bitcoind (`lightning-block-sync`) and for esplora (`lightning-transaction-sync`) out-of-the-box.
