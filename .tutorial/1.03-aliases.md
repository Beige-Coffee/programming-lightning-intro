# Aliases

The workbook comes with a couple of aliases that will be useful as we begin to program Lightning. Each alias executes a Bitcoin remote procedure call (RPC) command under the hood, interacting with the node running in the background of this workbook. These aliases are designed to simplify executing those commands, and links to the underlying documentation for each command are also provided. Before we dive in, let’s take a minute to get familiar with them and try a few out.

## Mine blocks

After broadcasting a transaction we will need blocks to be mined. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/generatetoaddress.html?highlight=generatetoaddress)

👉 Try mining a block!

```
mine 1
```

Mining blocks is useful when you need confirmations on any transaction but in this workshop it will be useful when opening and closing lightning channels.

## Broadcast Raw Transaction

👉 Broadcast a raw transaction. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendrawtransaction.html)

```
sendtx <raw tx hex>
```

## Decode Raw Transaction

👉 Decode a raw transaction so that it's easy to see the various inputs, outputs, and other transaction information. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendrawtransaction.html)

```
decodetx <raw tx hex>
```

## Get Transaction

👉 Retrieve information about a broadcasted transaction. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendrawtransaction.html)

```
gettx <tx id>
```

## Get UTXO

👉 Retrieve information about a UTXO. If no information is returned, that UTXO does not exist. [See documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendrawtransaction.html)

```
getutxo <tx id> <output index>
```
