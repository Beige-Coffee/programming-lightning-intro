# Aliases

The workbook comes with a couple of aliases that will be useful as we begin to program Lightning. Each alias executes a Bitcoin remote procedure call (RPC) command under the hood, interacting with the node running in the background of this workbook. These aliases are designed to simplify executing those commands, and links to the underlying documentation for each command are also provided. Before we dive in, letâ€™s take a minute to get familiar with them and try a few out.

## Mine blocks

For a transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain, it will have to be included in a block. To do this, you can use the below alias. For this workshop, we'll mine blocks to open and close our lightning channels. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/generatetoaddress.html?highlight=generatetoaddress)

ðŸ‘‰ Try mining a block!

```
mine 1
```

Technically, this command will also send bitcoin to our on-chain wallet. So you can use this command if you need some on-chain funds.

## Broadcast Raw Transaction

ðŸ‘‰ Broadcast a raw transaction. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendrawtransaction.html)

```
sendtx <raw tx hex>
```

## Decode Raw Transaction

ðŸ‘‰ Decode a raw transaction so that it's easy to see the various inputs, outputs, and other transaction information. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/decoderawtransaction.html)

```
decodetx <raw tx hex>
```

## Get Transaction

ðŸ‘‰ Retrieve information about a broadcasted transaction. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/gettransaction.html?highlight=gettransaction)

```
gettx <tx id>
```

## Get UTXO

ðŸ‘‰ Retrieve information about a UTXO. If no information is returned, that UTXO does not exist. [See documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/gettxout.html)

```
getutxo <tx id> <output index>
```
